# remark-details

It's a tokenizer for remark to support [details plugin in pymdown](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/details/).

Compiler support is also added, tested locally and worked perfectly with remark-lint.

The `compile-to-latex` branch was used in [remark-latex](https://github.com/Ir1d/remark-latex) which was used to compile `.md` to `.tex` for [**OI Wiki**](https://github.com/24OI/OI-wiki), only tested locally.
