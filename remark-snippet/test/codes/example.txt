Once upon a time, there was a programmer.
    They wrote code every day.
    If the code worked:
        They would smile and drink coffee.
        They might even share it online.
    Else:
        They would debug for hours.
            Sometimes, they would scream internally.
    Eventually, the program ran flawlessly.
The end of chapter one.

/* --8<-- [end:chapter-one] */
// --8<-- [end:chapter-four]

In a faraway land, a designer opened their favorite tool.
    They sketched ideas with care and precision.
    If the client approved:
        The designer would celebrate with a walk.
    Else:
// --8<-- [start:chapter-two]
        They would revise tirelessly.
            Colors changed. Shapes shifted.
    In time, the perfect design emerged.
The end of chapter two.

Late at night, a writer stared at a blinking cursor.
    They typed a sentence, then deleted it.
    If inspiration struck:
        Words flowed like a river.
            Paragraphs stacked into pages.
// --8<-- [start:chapter-two]
    Else:
        The cursor blinked in silence.
    But eventually, the story found its voice.
The end of chapter three.
